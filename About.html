            <p>The purpose of this bioSite is to help anyone who is curious to know what it is like to be a forensic psychologist and the work it would take to become one. With the current rise in interest for things such as true crime TV and true crime podcasts, there will certainly be more and more people who are curious about what that world really is like and the perspectives of the people who work within this field.</p>     
            <p>Claire Fleming is a close friend of mine and she has always been someone I have respected simply for the depth of knowledge and passion that she possesses for things of this nature. It was through casual conversations that I learned more about how a lot of people tend to operate psychologically which helps me better understand her anecdotes of the things she sees. She also does a great job of explaining anything I might have questions about. So it was an easy choice for me to choose her as the focus of this bioSite.</p>
