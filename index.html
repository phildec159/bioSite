            <p>In a world that seems to be driving itself towards more conflict and aggression as opposed to healing, we might often find ourselves wondering why some people commit the crimes they do. For those of us who could never think of harming someone else, it seems like an impossible task to be able to try to see any reason for a crime to take place. However, there are a select group of people who do consider all sorts of variables that could lead someone to commit a crime and they are forensic psychologists. A good friend of mine, Claire Fleming, is someone who is working towards becoming a professional forensic psychologist and as someone who already has some experience working with convicted criminals in a rehabilitation program, I thought she would be a great person to interview and see if she might help people who aren’t looking to go into the field understand why this line of work could be important. </p>
            <p>The realization of her interest in this field of work began when she was much younger and she could recount watching many episodes of Law & Order: SVU. Within that show was a character by the name of Dr. Huang who was a forensic psychologist. Dr. Huang’s ability to help victims and reveal things about the perpetrators taught Claire that sometimes, it is important to be able to see these individuals as more than just their crime. Understanding the circumstances that lead to a perpetrator’s crimes could be critical in providing assistance to similar individuals and possibly preventing future crimes from happening. </p>
            <p>Claire has been working diligently towards this career goal and is currently on her way to entering into a PhD program. When her education is complete, I look forward to seeing the milestones she achieves in her career and the people who she will help along the way.</p>
